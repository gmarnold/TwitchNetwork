# TwitchNetwork

by Grace Arnold and Gladys Toledo-Rodriguez

This project was written in Jupyter Notbooks, so if possible, please run the TwitchNetwork.ipynb
file in Jupyter Notebooks.

If you'd prefer, you can run the TwitchNetwork.py file. Please make sure that you first install the 
TwitchAPI and networkx python libraries with the following commands:

pip install twitchAPI
pip install networkx[default]

After installing and running the TwitchNetwork.py file, the graph.csv file will be populated
with node information. The graph and histograms will also be generated.
